# Capital Flow Schedule Module (cfsm)

The cfsm creates a CSV file using the target stock list previously generated in the stock screener module. Start dates and end dates are determined by the target stockâ€™s selected derivative expiry date (PUTS, CALLS) and ex-dividend date. The CSV file will be used to create the capital flow and the trade flow schedule.
