# Stock Screener Module (ssm)

This module that generates a subset (b) from a superset (a) of stock names based on a screening criteria. Additional sub-subsets (c), etc. of the subset are created by applying additional criterias (fundamental analysis, etc) to eventually generate one final subset (the target stock list).
